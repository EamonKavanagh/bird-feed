# Bird Feed: a real-time bird tracker for Central Park.

Bird Feed is an app that lets you see bird activity near Central Park in real-time.  You can find 'trending' birds (most sightings over the last minute), which birds are near your location in a 50 meter radius, and bird hotspots.  Additionally, Bird Feed provides historical data for the total and unique number of sightings over the past seven days.  This information can be seen for all birds, by family, or by specific bird.

Bird Feed is powered by:

- Kafka
- HDFS
- Spark
- Flink
- Cassandra
- Elasticsearch
- Flask

## Data Generation & Ingestion

Since there isn't a data source with enough velocity and volume to thoroughly test the infasructure, all records are manufactured.  Bird names, families, and images were scraped from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's website [All About Birds](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/search/).  

Manufacted data in the form of JSON records containing name, family, latitude, longitude, and timestamp are generated by randomly selecting a bird out of 250,000 unique candidates.  Each sample is taken from a Gaussian Distribution over the indicies of the array of candidates.  Periodically this array is shuffled to have different dynamics throughout the day.  Once a bird is selected, a latitude and longitude are randomly generated (uniform) between two bounds that surround Central Park.  The timestamp is also generated at creation time and given a random (Gaussian) delay to simulate out-of-order sensor data.

Each record is placed onto a Kafka queue where it is broadcast to the rest of the pipeline.  The data is stored in HDFS in sequential 20MB files for daily batch processing.
